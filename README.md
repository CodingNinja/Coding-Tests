# The test

You have been tasked with building an adventure game. The game consists of a 2 dimensional world of different types of terrain and a player character that is capable of moving around the game world. Dotted around the landscape are items (tools, food, weapons, etc) that the player may pick up and interact with. The player may hold up to 5 of these items in their inventory. Each time the player moves, their stamina is reduced by an amount depending on the terrain type. Food may be eaten to replenish stamina.
